Course Highlights:

- In this course, I began by familiarizing myself with the Excel interface, which provided a solid foundation for the rest of the course.
- I then moved on to learning how to sort and filter data, which made handling large datasets much easier.
- The next step was mastering formulas, where I learned to control calculations, understand the order of precedence, and calculate percentage differences and profit margins.
- As I progressed, I explored various Excel functions, such as INSERT and AUTOSUM, as well as functions for cleaning and standardizing data, working with dates and times, and using logical functions.
- The course wrapped up with a final project, where I had the opportunity to create an executive data summary, applying everything I had learned.
- This hands-on project was a fantastic way to consolidate my skills and see the practical applications of my new knowledge.
